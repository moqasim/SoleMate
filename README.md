# SoleMate
React application to buy shoes rendered via 3rd party API

solemte is an e-commerce web-app that allows users to browse through different brands of shoes and eventually checkout in the future.

users will have to first log in with anyname they'd like but the email is set to "johndoe@ga.com" and the password is "hello123". once in the app you can navigate between the different components. 

I want my users to appreciate a simple outline and design navigating through the app. As a user i want to be able to see multiple brands and be able to see the issue with different sizes.
